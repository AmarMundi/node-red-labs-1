# Text to Speech in Node-RED

Learn how to build a HTTP endpoint that takes text input and returns an audio file from the Watson Text to Speech service. In the second part, create a webpage that takes user input via a form and plays the audio of the text. Each section may take 5-10 minutes to complete.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [node-red-text-to-speech.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-text-to-speech/node-red-text-to-speech.pdf). Each section of the lab progressively modifies the previous section's Node-RED flow to demonstrate functionality you can include in your application.

## Code Snippets

HTML and JSON code used in this Node-RED tutorial is provided for your convenience in the following files:

* [1-form.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-text-to-speech/code/1-form.html) A form to collect user input
* [2-dynamic-name.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-text-to-speech/code/2-dynamic-name.html) A webpage that plays the audio from user input
* [3-complete-flow.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-text-to-speech/code/3-complete-flow.json) Import this JSON into Node-RED to build the completed flow.
