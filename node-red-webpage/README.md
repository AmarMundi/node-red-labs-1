# Building a Webpage with HTTP nodes in Node-RED

Learn how to deploy a basic webpage in Node-RED, add JavaScript to make the webpage dynamic, and finally, use query parameters from the URL in the webpage. Each section may take 5-10 minutes to complete.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [node-red-webpage.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-webpage/node-red-webpage.pdf). Each section of the lab progressively modifies the previous section's Node-RED flow to demonstrate funcitonality you can include in your application.

## Code Snippets

HTML and JSON code used in this Node-RED tutorial is provided for your convenience in the following files:

* [1-basic-webpage.html](code/1-basic-webpage.html) Deploy a static webpage in Node-RED
* [2-dynamic-name.html](code/2-dynamic-name.html) Prompt the user's name and include in the webpage
* [3-url-parameter.html](code/3-url-parameter.html) Include a user's name included in the query paramter name
* [4-complete-flow.json](code/4-complete-flow.json) Import this JSON into Node-RED to build the completed flow.
