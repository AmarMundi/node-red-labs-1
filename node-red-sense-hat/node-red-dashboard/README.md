Learn how to use the Node-RED dashboard nodes to build a UI to display sensor data.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [lab-sense-hat-node-red-dashboard.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/blob/master/lab-sense-hat/dashboard/lab-sense-hat-node-red-dashboard.pdf).

## Code Snippets

JSON code of Node-RED flows created in this lab is provided for your convenience in the following files:

* [1-display-sensor-data.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/blob/master/lab-sense-hat/dashboard/code/1-display-sensor-data) Node-RED flow to display temperature, humidity, and pressure values in the Node-RED dashboard.
* [2-display-temperature-humidity-gauge.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-sense-hat/dashboard/code/2-display-temperature-humidity-gauge.json) Node-RED flow to display temperature and humidity values as gauges.
* [3-display-temperature-chart.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-sense-hat/dashboard/code/3-display-temperature-chart.json) Node-RED flow to display temperature as a line chart.
