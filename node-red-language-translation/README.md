# Language Translation in Node-RED

Learn how to build a flow that translates text into another language. In the second part, create a webpage that takes user input via a form and translates the text into another language. Each section may take 5-10 minutes to complete.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [node-red-language-translation.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-language-translation/node-red-language-translation.pdf).

## Code Snippets

HTML and JSON code used in this Node-RED tutorial is provided for your convenience in the following files:

* [1-form.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-language-translation/code/1-form.html) A form to collect user input
* [2-process-form.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-language-translation/code/2-process-form.html) A webpage that displays the translated text
* [3-complete-flow.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-language-translation/code/3-complete-flow.json) Import this JSON into Node-RED to build the completed flow.
