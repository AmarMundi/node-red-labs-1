# Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix in Node-RED

Learn how to build a flow that displays a variety of weather data from the Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix REST API endpoints. In these tutorials, weâ€™ll get the current weather conditions, forecasted weather for the next ten days, retrieve weather alerts, use the weather almanac to find conditions over time, and use time series weather conditions for the last 24 hours to see how the weather has changed.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [node-red-weather-company-data.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-weather-company-data/node-red-weather-company-data.pdf).
