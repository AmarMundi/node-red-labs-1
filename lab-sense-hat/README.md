# Raspberry Pi using Sense HAT

This workshop is split into four components: Node-RED IoT starter in IBM Bluemix, displaying IoT data using the Watson IoT Platform dashboard, displaying IoT data using the Node-RED dashboard, and commanding the Sense HAT from the Watson IoT Platform.

It is recommended to go through the labs in the following order:

1. [Create a Node-RED application to subscribe to Watson IoT Events](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/blob/master/lab-sense-hat/iot-starter)
2. [Watson IoT Platform Dashboard](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/blob/master/lab-sense-hat/watson-dashboard)
3. [Node-RED Dashboard](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/blob/master/lab-sense-hat/node-red-dashboard)
4. [Commanding the Sense HAT via Watson IoT](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/blob/master/lab-sense-hat/commands)

## Getting Started

Each part of this workshop contains a PDF with steps to complete the given tasks. Completed flows, located in the companion ```code``` directory, can be imported via the Import => Clipboard menu option in Node-RED.
