# Commanding the Sense HAT via Watson IoT

Learn how to use Node-RED dashboard in IBM Bluemix to send an IoT Command to Node-RED on the Raspberry Pi and control the Sense HAT 8x8 LED display.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [lab-sense-hat-commands.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/blob/master/lab-sense-hat/commands/lab-sense-hat-commands.pdf).
